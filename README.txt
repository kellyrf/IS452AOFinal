Welcome to the IS452AOFinal wiki!

This final project will be a hybrid of programming and programming proposal. The focus of this program will be to teach young adults through a workshop the basics of Python and programming. The programming proposal will include focus points for educating young adults on programming languages, as well as the necessary materials for facilitating the program in any public/academic library seeking programming opportunities. Then, this will also include the program and presentation points necessary for the actual workshop - what the young adults will be learning, and what kind of code they will be able to walk away with. This project’s intention is to provide teen librarians with a STEM-related workshop that can be guided by a recorded version of the workshop or by the librarian themselves. The program that teens will walk away with will be a “Choose Your Own Adventure” program (after the books of the same concept), where teens can construct or use a pre-constructed script for the program. They will learn from this how to use variables, ifs, loops, prints, etc.



Objectives:

Through the basic teachings of Python, create a short program to run through a “Choose Your Own Adventure” Story.
Basics include - opening the shell, creating a program, print statements, strings, for loops, if/else statements, functions, input prompts, and output.

Instruction:
Opening the shell
Creating a program
Printing a string
Variables
Prompt for input
if/else statements
Functions
Running a program

All instruction for these 8 fundamentals will be within the code provided in this github.
